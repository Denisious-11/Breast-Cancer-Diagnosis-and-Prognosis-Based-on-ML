In the context of breast cancer:

Recurrent (R): This refers to cases where the cancer has returned or recurred after an initial period of treatment and being declared disease-free. Recurrence indicates that cancer cells have regrown or spread, leading to a return of the disease.

Non-recurrent (N): This indicates cases where the cancer has not returned after the initial treatment, and the patient remains disease-free.

The second field seems to be related to time, indicating the recurrence time if the outcome is recurrent (field 2 = R) or disease-free time if the outcome is non-recurrent (field 2 = N).
